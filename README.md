## Installation
**DO NOT INSTALL THIS SEPARATELY FROM MODPACK INSTANCES WITHOUT , YOU CAN BROKE EVERYTHING!**

### Modpacks

For simple installation, consider installing one of these packs:
- [Base b1.7.3 MultiMC pack (Modpacks and b1.7.3 based mods)](https://github.com/ChessChicken-KZ/Archaism-Underscore/releases/download/1-0.1/ArchaismUnderscore_1-0.1_b1.7.3.zip)
- (WIP)

## Q/A

### How to install this thing with mods like ReIndev/BTA/NSSS/etc?
To install a b1.7.3 based modification (as for instance ReIndev or BTA) download `Base b1.7.3 MultiMC pack` from above.

After unpacking, add your mod as a `jar mod` and move it after `Minecraft` (or replace it) but it should be before `ArchaismUnderscore` mod.
