- [X] Small and quick mod loader.
- [X] Launch from launchwrapper.

## Q/A

### How to install this thing with mods like ReIndev/BTA/NSSS/etc?
To install a b1.7.3 based modification (as for instance ReIndev or BTA) download `Base b1.7.3 MultiMC pack` from above.

After unpacking, add your mod as a `jar mod` and move it after `Minecraft` (or replace it) but it should be before `ArchaismUnderscore` mod.
